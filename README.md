# currentWeatherApp

Created a simple weather app that gets current user location and outputs the current temperature along with a map of the user's location.

1. Gets user location when user clicks on get weather.
2. Makes an API call to obtain JSON of current weather at that location.
3. Displays weather and makes call to Google map api to display map of user location.
